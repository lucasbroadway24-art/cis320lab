	<a>The developers Ninja Kiwi like to add lore to their games, and here's some fun facts about them:
		One of the heros, Pat Fusty, is a Minecraft PVP legend.  Yes, that Minecraft.
		
		The radiation that the Biggest One and the Bloontonium reactor emit a special type of radiation that doesn't affect the enviorment and only harms bloons
		
		Bloons are an entirely seperate entity from Balloons, with one being a harmless childrens toy and the other a consumer of hopes and dreams.
		
		Some bloons infiltrated a Birthday party disguised as Balloons, but their plans were foiled by a well-aimed birthday cake.
		
		There's a monkey inside everything, even the bloons.</a>
