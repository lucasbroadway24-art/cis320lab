<title>Top 5 worst BTD6 towers</title>

	<h1>Number 5; the sun Avatar</h1>
	<img src="Sun Avatar.jpg">
	<a>its extremely fairly priced for its damage, but you have to invest alot of money into it for very mediocre damage that still needs support.  And for a 37,260 dollar investment, you have to hold on for while if this is your primary source of damage.</a>
	<h2>Number 4; lazer gunner</h2>
	<img src="laser.jpg">
	<a>it's expensive for what is does, requires micro, and it's buildup is awful; its upgrades give lackluster buffs, its almost always weak to purple and lead balloons, and still requires micro to be good.  And while it's tier 5 is stupid expensive, once you buy it, you've pretty much won the game, so it can piggyback off of another weaker strategy and win the game.</a>
	<h3>Number 3; the Tsar Bomba</h3>
	<img src="Tsar.jpg">
	<a>while it is somewhat cheap for its damage, you need to pair it with alot of stalling to make it work.  Also, the rounds often space out their attacks to you can't take out a round with one big bomb, so its awkward to use on 90% of all rounds.  It also does terrible BAD damage; the boss balloon at the end of the game. This is all terrible since its your main DPS that's supposed to scale lategame.</a>
	<h4>Number 2; the Pop and Awe</h4>
	<img src="Pop and Awe">
	<a>same as tsar bomba but with no redeeming qualities.  Its a 25,000 screenwipe vs a 40,000 stun. The top path can do far damage, is much cheaper, and stuns it in it's base attack as opposed to an ability.</a>
	<h5>Number 1; Homeland Defense</h5>
	<img src="Homeland Defense.jpg">
	<a>If you've been paying attention, you may notice a theme running through these towers; expensive, weak, outclassed.  Well take all of those downsides, push them to their limits, and you have the homeland defense.  It is a village so it does no damage on its own, the buffs, being no balloon resistance, can be handled by pretty much any other tower in the game while dealing respectable damage.  The Call to arms gives a temporary 50% attack speed buff for 21k, while the overclock can give 66% with near-permanent uptime at 14k, and the homeland defense gives a temporary 100% attack speed buff at 40k.  Totaling in a 70,000$ tower that does no damage on its own with lackluster buffs.  You could get an Anti-Bloon for that kind of money and instantly win.  Heck, The Tsar Bomba costs less and its a screenwipe.</a>
